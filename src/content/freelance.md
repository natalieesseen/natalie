title: Freelancing as a digitial illustrator
---

I freelance under my internet persona / brandname *cafeaunat* (a wordplay on <i>café au lait</i> and Natalie). I primarily create digital illustrations, and work with project based custom commissions with international clients. I also provide premade pay-to-use assets that are available on e-commerce marketplaces like Etsy.

In early 2021, after freelancing a bit as a graphic designer; I joined a program by eXpression Umeå, called Express — a program for startups. I applied with my business idea to create graphics and digital illustrations for content creators and live streamers on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube.

It began with my focus on *stream overlays*, leveraging my background in graphic design; I did a few commissions but also posted a few premade packages on e-commerce marketplaces like Etsy. However, I eventually found more success with my digital illustrations, even without a formal education or prior experience as an illustrator.

My ongoing freelancing journey is characterized by creativity and continuous growth. This journey has taught me a multitude of skills, ranging from administrative work like bookeeping and project managing - to marketing and networking, but also the creative aspect of improving my skillset in digital illustration. I am forever grateful for the people I've worked with, and nothing brings me more joy than seeing my illustrations being used and loved by my customers and their communities.
